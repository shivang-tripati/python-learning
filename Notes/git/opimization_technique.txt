// Let’s discuss some code optimization techniques that can improve the performance of your program. I’ll focus on the provided Java code snippet and suggest improvements.

Compile Time Evaluation:
Evaluate expressions at compile time if possible. For instance:
Java

// Before optimization
int x = 12;
int y = x / 2;

// After optimization (evaluated at compile time)
int y = 6;

Variable Propagation:
Propagate variable values to reduce redundancy. For example:
Java

// Before optimization
int c = a * b;
int d = c + 4;

// After optimization
int d = a * b + 4;

Constant Propagation:
Replace variables with constants if their values are known:
Java

// Before optimization
int k = 2;
if (k) {
    // ...

// After optimization (evaluate condition)
// The condition is always true (k = 2)
// So, it simplifies to:
// if (true) {
// ...

Constant Folding:
Compute expressions with constant values at compile time:
Java

// Before optimization
#define k 5
int x = 2 * k;

// After optimization (evaluated at compile time)
int x = 10;
